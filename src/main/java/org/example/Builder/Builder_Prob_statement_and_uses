Let's say we want to create a Computer object with various optional components like a CPU, RAM, storage,
graphics card, and an operating system. We'll use the Builder Pattern to construct the Computer object.

especially when there are many optional components or configurations.
It also ensures that the Computer object remains immutable after construction,
which can be valuable in certain scenarios.
